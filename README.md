# Week-1-Challenge

<h2>Description</h1>

This contains my submission for Week 1's coding Challenge. Our challenge was to refactor the provided code to be more in-line with accessibility standards, and have improved legibility for future collaborating developers on the team.

<h2>Process</h2>


The html file was adjusted to contain semantic element descriptions. For example, our main navigation links have been relabelled *nav* inside it's parent container *header*. Semantic htmls tags such as section, article, aside and footer were utilised for their respective parts.


Additionally, I consolidated the css to be more legible to collaborating developers. New CSS classes were created to condense the amount of code, descriptions were added via comments, and unused classes were removed. During my process I *commented out* existing classes to ensure new code worked accordingly. 

Additional css styling was implemented to create a more interactive experience based on this weeks classes.
